# Beerlympics
Hello ! It seems you have either wandered too far into wisconsin culture, or you have been invited to a beerlympics event !

## Gameplay
* The Beerlympics are multiple beer-drinking related events organized into competition.
* Teams are ranked by points that are increased/decreased throughout the course of the event.
* Activities are chosen round-robin style with each team captain spinning *The Wheel*. Some activities require all participants, some activities will be direct challenges. 


## Skips 
* Each team gets one opportunity to **Skip** an event after rolling it on the wheel.
* In order for a team to use their skip, the majority must decide to skip.
* If a team refuses an event *without* a **Skip**, they must face punishment of ***1 Drink***

## Points 
* Points are awarded by completing activities. Points are removed by special clause. 
* Each Activity has points scaled based on its contents
